# Car Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project aims to predict car prices in Australia for the year 2023 using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains extensive information on car listings, including various features influencing car prices.

## About the Dataset

The dataset consists of car listings collected from various online platforms in Australia. It contains over 16,000 records with detailed information such as brand, year, model, car/suv, title, used/new, transmission, engine, drive type, fuel type, fuel consumption, kilometres, colour (exterior/interior), location, cylinders in the engine, body type, doors, seats, and price.

### Dataset Source:
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and provides the latest information on car prices in Australia for the year 2023.

### Data Preprocessing:
The following preprocessing steps were performed on the dataset:
- Handling missing values: Removed missing values from the dataset.
- Encoding: Encoded categorical variables for model compatibility.
- Splitting: Segmented the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Machine Learning Techniques Used
This project utilized the following machine learning algorithms:
- Linear Regression: Used for establishing a linear relationship between features and car prices.
- Non-linear Regression: Implemented to capture non-linear relationships between variables and prices.
- Confusion Matrix: Employed for evaluating model performance and accuracy.
